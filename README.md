this is my alakajam2 game jam to entry. didnt have the time to do more then
a raw prototype of a game. no sound, no logo no grafics and no time to code 
more then i had done.

first time i use java. in my last few game jems (ludom dare)
i used javascript dom and canvas frameworks. exept for the first
they all field (but people liked the second one too).
anyway this time i wanted to try desktop game dev.

in any case it was a great experience and learnd alot from it like every time.
